Incredible facts you should know about Utah's Bear Lake

Spanning the border of Utah and Idaho, Bear Lake, nicknamed "the Caribbean of the Rockies" for its stunning turquoise-blue water, is a destination everyone should put on their bucket list. Bear Lake offers hiking, bike riding, boating, fishing, bird watching and cave exploring — and that's just scratching the surface.

If you've never been to Bear Lake, you owe it to yourself to go, because it's not just another mountain lake. Here are some of the things that make Bear Lake unique.

Why it's blue

When you crest the mountain summit and catch a first glimpse of the lake, the rich color is the first thing you notice.

"Bear Lake contains abundant suspended microscopic particles of white-colored calcium carbonate (lime) that reflect the water’s natural blue color back to the surface, giving the lake its intense turquoise-blue color," explains information from the Utah Geological Survey.

Camp or picnic at the beach

The lake has 48 miles of shoreline and there are sandy beaches galore. Even when the water might be too cold for swimming, there are opportunities for camping and picnicking in scenic splendor.

Don't miss Rendevous Beach, a state park that is family-friendly and provides camping, day use and group areas.

And if you still want to get in the water, the Garden City pool is open year-round.

It's deep and big

In contrast to the shallow beaches, the average overall depth of the lake is 94 feet. It drops down more than 200 feet in its deepest spot. When the lake is full, it's surface covers 110 square miles. It is more than 20 miles long and about eight miles wide.

Bike around Bear Lake

With about 50 miles of stunning views and prime-time weather, as well as a road that doesn't have much elevation gain, the area is a favorite destination for cyclers. The best time for riding is May through October.
