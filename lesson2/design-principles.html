            <h3>REPETITION</h3>
            <a href="https://www.motogp.com" target="_blank"><h4>motogp.com</h4></a>
            <p>The principle of repetition can be seen in this website in the little icon every article has. This 
                way an asiduos visitor can see what type of article it is even without looking at the title. You
                can see this repeated all over the page, so you know if is an interview, article, video, and if
                it's free or requires a subscription.

            <a href="https://www.shortify.co/JP2DHeUp/" target="_blank"><h4>google.com</h4></a>
            <p>The Hick's Law can be observed all the time in google's results. In this case, when I searched
                about the "Hick's Law", the first result is the answer I needed. This way I don't need to choose
                a link to follow because I have what I need in front of my eyes already, and, if I want to know 
                more I can follow that same link.

            <a href="http://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank"><h4>sololearn.com</h4></a>
            <p>The principle of proximity in this website can be observed in the logo and name of the course with it's 
                information really close to it, and then in the botton, the statistics and information of the course.
                When you start scrolling the website this organization makes the information very easy to read because 
                you already know where it's located.
