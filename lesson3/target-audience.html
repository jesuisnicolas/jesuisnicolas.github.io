        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p> * Charles wants to cook a barbecue for her family. He buys everything he needs a couple days before, but that morning
            sees some suspicious clouds on the horizon. The forecast says there's a 50/50 chance of rain, but he can use
            the radar information in <span class="brand">Weather GO!</span> to know where the rain clouds are in real time. Finally, 
            he is able to finish cooking 15 minutes before starts to rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            * Marlene is planning to upload a new video to her accounts demostrating a new routine she learned from a exercises "guru".
            As the routine references the conection between her body and mother earth, she needs to shoot outside. She will use <span class="brand">
            Weather GO!</span> to plan which day she'll shoot, taking in account the time it will take filming.
        </p>
        <p> * Charles is preparing a surprise for her wife for their aniversary. He's planning a romantic picnic, just like the one 
            they had short before they first met. But, he needs to double check the weather to make sure he can do it outside. If the 
            forecast says it will rain, he'll have to think in something else.
