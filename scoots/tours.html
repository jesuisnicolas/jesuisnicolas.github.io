                <h3>Lighthouse Punta Molas</h3>
                <p>Punta Molas is the boundary that marks the northern end of the coast of the island of Cozumel,
                    Quintana Roo, Mexico. On site there is an old lighthouse and some of the most beautiful beaches of
                    the island of Cozumel. Accessed by a narrow unpaved road surrounded by tropical vegetation, passable
                    all year.

                <p>    
                    Punta Molas is one of the most important places to visit in Cozumel, is one of those places where
                    you can distinguish much of the Mexican coast of the Riviera Maya, the Lighthouse, the Tomb Caracol,
                    who are in this place, and from where they are arriving cruise ships and yachts that come to the
                    island.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    The road is a bit complicated so it is recommended to have all-terrain trucks, at the end of the day
                    will be the best experience I have lived since the end of the hard drive you will find the beautiful
                    turquoise waters and white sand belonging to this part of the coast. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    A mystical place where you can visit the Tomb Caracol, an archaeological site where beauty speaks
                    for itself. From the lighthouse you can see the cruise ships and yachts arriving in the northern
                    island of Cozumel Channel. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Formerly, it was from here that the Maya could see the arrival of large storms.</p>
